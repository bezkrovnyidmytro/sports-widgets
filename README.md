# sports-widgets

Hi all!

This is the main part of the project I've been working on for the past few months.
I removed all private information and left only the part that characterizes me as a programmer.

About the project: we have created a plugin that allows you to select bets on sports (football) in real-time.

Technologies: PHP, OOP, MVC, WordPress, Gutenberg blocks, shortcodes, JS, AJAX, REST API, Cron, React.js, customization.

Unfortunately, my other projects and developments are subject to NDA and I do not want to violate the terms of my contract :)

I hope for your understanding. 

Best regards, DB.
